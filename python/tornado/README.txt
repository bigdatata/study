Tornado is a Python web framework and asynchronous networking library, originally developed at FriendFeed.
By using non-blocking network I/O, Tornado can scale to tens of thousands of open connections, making it ideal for
long polling, WebSockets, and other applications that require a long-lived connection to each user.
